# README

App for MasterOfCode's test.
Assignment:
* Write a weather reader from several sources using Ruby on Rails
* Sources are stacked statically
* User can add an infinite number of cities where to look at the weather.
* User enters the name of the city in the field. It should be a possibility to detect the city automatically too.
* System searches for weather forecasts for definite this city and shows aggregate data - minimum and maximum predicted temperature and probability of rain/snow.
* You must display the results without reloading the page
* If the user enters further queries, then the new forecasts appear above the previous users
* An auto identifier is assigned, it is written in cookies and then after it, after closing the browser, you need to see your previous inquiries.
* Also, user should have possibility to enter his email on the some profile page. If predicted weather is changed, user should receive an email with the new prediction.
* All code for models and controllers is covered by tests.
* All code must be placed on the github or on the similar git repository.
* All neccessary DB data for development should be placed in the seeds.rb file.
* ADDITIONAL (would be a big plus): Project setup should be based on the Docker Compose. (place .env, .Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml files into the root of project)

I've done almost all highlights, except tests and Docker integration.
And due to certain force majeure overdue it by almost two weeks.
